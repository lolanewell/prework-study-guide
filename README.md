# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for bootcamp students doing their Prework. It supports them by creating a space were all relavant notes on topics learnt during the Prework are consolidated in one place. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

I built this project to not only help bootcamp students doing their Prework, but to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
