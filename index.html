        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Inside the head element we can use the following metadata tags:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage.</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
            <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
            <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the chracter set, description, keywords, author, and viewpoint.</li>
            <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. Common child elements inside the body element:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements represent the leel of heading a given text block represents.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
            <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
            <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li> 
            <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
            <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Incline CSS.</li>
          <p>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</p>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheet.</li>
          <p>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directy in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</p> 
          <li>External CSS style sheet.</li>
          <p>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>CSS Rule</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Selector - a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations - declarations contain two important components:
            <ul>
              <li>The CSS property we want to apply.</li>
              <li>The value of the property.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>CSS Rules:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
